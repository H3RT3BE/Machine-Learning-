# Project Description

This repository encompasses data and implementations pertaining to the analysis of municipal indicators within the Sabana region. The project leverages two primary datasets:

## 1. Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC:

This file, `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC`, operates as a dictionary for the corresponding dataset. It is utilized in conjunction with code developed from scratch, making use of the dataset `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA`.

## 2. Kaggle Dataset:

A Kaggle dataset has been specifically chosen for its applicability to the decision tree algorithm (`Decision_Tree`).

# File Structure

- `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC`: Contains the dictionary essential for the Sabana dataset.
- `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA`: Holds the dataset used during the development phase.
- `Decision_Tree`: Encompasses files associated with the implementation and analysis using the decision tree algorithm.

# Usage

## Working with Data from Scratch:

Utilize the `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC` dictionary to process data obtained from `Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA`.

## Decision Tree:

Employ the Kaggle dataset within the `Decision_Tree` directory to conduct analyses leveraging the decision tree algorithm.
