Project Description
This repository contains data and implementations related to the analysis of municipal indicators in the Sabana region. Two main datasets are utilized:

Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC:

This file, Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC, serves as a dictionary for the corresponding dataset. It is used in conjunction with code developed from scratch, which utilizes the dataset Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA.
Kaggle Dataset:

A Kaggle dataset is employed specifically for working with the decision tree algorithm (Decision_Tree).
File Structure
Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC: Contains the dictionary used for the Sabana dataset.

Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA: Contains the dataset used for development.

Decision_Tree: Includes files related to the implementation and analysis using the decision tree algorithm.

Usage
Working with Data from Scratch:

Utilize the Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DIC dictionary to work with data obtained from Indicadores_municipales_sabana_DA.
Decision Tree:

Employ the Kaggle dataset in the Decision_Tree folder to perform analysis using the decision tree algorithm.
